See also: [[Cookbook.WikiOnAStick|wiki on a stick]] for more info.%0a%0a!!!alturo.de%0agerman low cost hoster (offspin from 1&1), works great with the "webmaster package" that also comes with shell access -[[~Uli]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#b]]%0a!! B%0a%0a!!![[https://www.biohost.de/|biohost.de]]%0a%0aThis is a small, personable one-man provider with good service and green electricity. My three big complicated websites are running fine. %0a%0a!!!Bionic-Hosting - unfortunately no longer with us%0a%0aA relatively new player in the field. I'm very happy with the results. I've got a lot of pagelisting and other resource-hungry scripts and still getting a reasonable speed. FTP and control panel always available (not always been so with other hosts in the past. -[[~DaveCooke]]%0a%0a----%0a[[#c]]%0a!! C%0a!!! [[(http://www.)canaca.com]]%0aI have found PmWiki works fine with this inexpensive webhost.%0aps: LUV UR work Patrick -- markndennis@hotmail.com%0a%0a!!!Canadian Web Hosting.com%0a[[http://www.canadianwebhosting.com/faq.asp]]%0aInexpensive, helpful, fast, tons of features with even the basic package (cpanel, mysql, php, FTP, WebMail, phpBB, couple of pre-loaded cgi scripts, Fantastico, php, Perl, thought it had Python but isn't on the list). Several packages between basic (which runs PmWiki) to virtual reseller packages, so something in every price range. Helpful support staff.%0a%0aTwice in 6 years something in mod_security or other server setting changed, which broke PmWiki. Therefore, can only partly-recommend as PmWiki host, which is a shame because they have great support, especially considering we only have the economy package. As soon as I narrowed it down to a server setting, they fixed it. However, it would be frustrating for someone who isn't familiar with PmWiki to begin with.%0a%0aNote: same name .ca is a different provider. [[~Sandy]]%0a%0a!!!www.cjb.cc - failed%0acjb.cc is a free webhost offering 100 MB free space without advertising.%0aI could change permissions to 2777, could install all PmWiki files, could test it and it worked!%0aSounds nice, well, it worked for about 10 seconds. Than I realized: many files were just deleted and I did remember that at this webhost only these:%0a.txt|\.htm|\.html|\.js|\.css|\.log|.cfg|\.jpg|\.gif|\.png|\.php|\.inc\.tpl %0afile types are allowed and%0a"Any other files located by Cjb.cc will be automatically deleted by the server."%0aYes, it did! -Armin%0a%0aOther free webhosts - failed too%0aI'll add the other failed webhosts I tried later. In all cases I could not change permission to 2777.%0a%0a-Armin%0a%0a----%0a[[#d]]%0a!! D%0a!!! [[(http://)data393.com]]%0a%0aThis is the web hosting service that originally hosted pmwiki.org and pmichaud.com.  So it works well with PmWiki.  Good rates, good service.%0a%0a----%0a[[#e]]%0a!! E%0a%0a----%0a[[#f]]%0a!! F%0a%0a!!! Fastdot.com%0a[[http://fastdot.com]]%0aNo issues, installs seamlessly. Runs with ModSecurity and CloudLinux for optimal performance and Wiki security. %0a%0a!!! [[(http://)futurequest.net]]%0aWorks well.  Cookbooks work well here, especially things like [[Cookbook:SpellChecker]] since FQ servers are all Linux.  Very flexible host for a shared host.  Not necessarily the cheapest, and doesn't provide as much space/bandwidth as others, but a very reliable host with good support. [[~Ccox]]%0a%0a!!!freenet.de - failed%0aFirst a quick comment: yesterday I filed my question about a list of succesful PmWiki installations in the faq section, and just a few hours later it has it's own folder and already 3 listed points - '''GREAT!'''%0a%0aMain problem with freenet.de (my payed webhost), I could not change the permission from 755 to 2777. Even 777 failed. I'm using [=FileZilla=] for ftp. In command line mode of [=FileZilla=] the command CHMODE is responded as unkown command.%0aDue to crummy support (forget email, don't ask about service phone) I tried also other webhosts (see next entry).%0aSorry for maybe wrong non-expert-expressions, but I'm a Wiki-Newbie.%0a-Armin%0a%0a->%25Pm%25 What version of PmWiki were you trying to install?  --Pm%0a->A: the actual one, or better to say it was the actual one last week (1.0.13) %0a->Meanwhile I know, why it failed at freenet. I need to upgrade their service, because actual package does not include php-support (and otheres). - Armin%0a%0a!!! [[(http://www.)free.fr]]%0aUpload pmwiki files, rename pmwiki.php to index.php5 and it works.%0a[[~noe]]%0a%0aYou can also create a .htaccess file at the root of your website, and add "PHP 1" to it, so it will automatically enable php5. [[~farvardin]]%0a%0aRight, I found a www.free.fr recommandation in the web as well: php support, cgi-bin, etc., but I would have to fight with this language -Armin %0a%0a----%0a%0a[[#g]]%0a!! G%0a!!! [[(http://)globalweb.com.ru]]%0aThis is another free host with FTP, PHP/MYSQL, Plesk control panel. 50 MB with 1000MB bandwidth per month. Has ads. Hosted using Redhat Linux.%0a%0a!!!What about godaddy? Any problems there?%0aNo problems at all -- on their LINUX servers.  Even supports ModRewrite based Clean URLs.  Windows servers don't seem to have PHP support listed.  ([[~XES]])%0a%0aWhen my site was at GoDaddy (using their linux economy package), my wiki pages took unacceptably long to render. (I have a large config.php and use lots of includes.) I moved to another host and the performance problem vanished. - RandyB%0a%0aGoDaddy is no longer supporting PmWiki. They are removing it from their "quick-install" list. - DaveJ%0a%0a12/7/20: GoDaddy offers PMWiki but offers no support for it, and sometimes their server changes simply break it or make certain pages impossible to save. A November 2020 update did this to several of my pages; they work fine on other servers, but not on GoDaddy's.%0a%0a----%0a[[#h]]%0a!!
