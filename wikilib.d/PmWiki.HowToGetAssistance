Review and research available information%0a* ensure you are, as much as possible, running the [[PmWiki:SiteAnalyzer | current version]] of all PmWiki, skins, and recipe software.%0a* review the current [[PmWiki/DocumentationIndex | documentation]] for updates and [[PmWiki:ChangeLog | changes]]%0a* search the [[PITS:PITS | PmWiki Issue Tracking System]] to see if the issue is already known about%0a* search the [[(PmWiki:)mailing lists]]%0a* search [[Site/Search | PmWiki]]%0a* inspect your current environment (see [[PmWiki/DebugVariables#EnableDiag | PHPInfo]])%0a* check the [[file permissions]]%0a* check the [[PmWiki/troubleshooting]] guide%0a* there is help on specific [[PmWiki:error messages]]%0a* see the [[PmWiki/FAQ]] and [[PmWiki:FAQ candidate]] pages%0a%0aSince a query may relate to any, or all, of%0a* environment ([[Wikipedia:Operating system | OS]], [[(Wikipedia:)web server]], [[https://php.net | PHP]])%0a* PmWiki ([[PmWiki/version]]), or [[Cookbook:/ | recipes]]%0a* functionality of PmWiki or PmWiki documentation%0athe appropriate and accurate information will go a long way to isolating a cause and determining a solution%0a%0a[[#reproduce]]%0a!! Reproduce the issue%0aThe next step is to reproduce the issue in a different environment if it is feasible.%0a* the PmWiki [[test/]] pages are a good place to do this%0a* consider disabling all recipes in [[PmWiki/LocalCustomizations | config.php]]. If the problem disappears add the recipes back in one at a time until the problem re-occurs%0a* another useful way is to create a [[PmWiki/WikiGroup | group]] and use a [[PmWiki/GroupCustomizations | group specific customisation]] to diagnose the problem%0a%0a!!
