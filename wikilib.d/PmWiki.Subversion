text=(:Summary:How to get the latest pre-release from the version control system:)%0aYou can get the latest development cutting-edge pre-release version of PmWiki. Note that a development version may not be as stable and as bug-free as [[PmWiki:Download|official releases]].%0a%0a!! Download pre-release zip archive%0a%0aYou can download the latest development code packed as a zip archive here:%0a[[(https://www.pmwiki.org/pub/pmwiki-devel/)pmwiki-latest-svn.zip]]. Note that the pmwiki.org site also usually runs with the latest code from Subversion, so it can be tested.%0a%0a!! Obtaining PmWiki via Subversion (svn)%0a%0aAnother way to obtain copies of PmWiki is via %0a%25newwin%25[[http://subversion.apache.org/|subversion]].  %0aFirst, you need a %0a%25newwin%25[[Wikipedia:Comparison_of_Subversion_clients|subversion client]]%0aof some sort to be able to access the repository.  %0aWe'll assume a command-line "svn" client here.%0a%0aThe latest release of PmWiki is available from ''svn://pmwiki.org/pmwiki/tags/latest''.  %0aTo use subversion to obtain a copy of the latest release, use a command like:%0a%0a->svn export svn://pmwiki.org/pmwiki/tags/latest pmwiki --force%0a%0aThis will obtain the latest release and place it into a "pmwiki"%0adirectory in your current directory.  When a new release comes%0aout and you wish to update to the latest release, simply repeat%0athe command above.  This will update your installation of pmwiki %0awith the latest release.%0a%0aIf you want the absolutely latest version that has been checked%0ainto the repository (which may contain unreleased features),%0ayou can use "svn export svn://pmwiki.org/pmwiki/trunk pmwiki --force"%0ainstead.%0a%0aSpecific versions of PmWiki are also available in the tags/ directory.%0aSo, if you update to the latest version and find that you need%0ato revert to a previous version, you can do%0a%0a->svn export svn://pmwiki.org/pmwiki/tags/pmwiki-2.1.26 pmwiki --force%0a%0ato make your current copy be updated to be the same as the 2.1.26%0arelease.  To get back to the latest release, just use the .../tags/latest%0aversion mentioned above.%0a%0aIf you are not sure what releases are available in the tags/ directory %0ayou can list them using the "svn ls" command as follows:%0a%0a->svn ls svn://pmwiki.org/pmwiki/tags/%0a%0a!!!Export vs Checkout%0a%0aAlternatively you can use svn checkout instead of svn export.  Some advantages to this include:%0a%0a* incremental updates — you only download what's changed since last revision;%0a* merging of changes — if you have modified one of the core files (although you shouldn't) svn will try to merge your changes with the latest version;%0a* easy patch creation — if you find a bug and fix it you can use @@svn diff filename.ext@@ to generate a patch file that can be submitted for next release.%0a%0aThe downside to using checkout is the wiki takes up twice the amount of disk space and you have hidden ".svn" subfolders which you will need to make sure your webserver doesn't serve to users.  The Apache web server will typically have a rule that blocks access to any file or directory beginning with a dot, so it shouldn't be an issue for most people.%0a%0a!!!Automating it%0a%0aIf you want a fully-automated and hassle-free upgrade/backup process, you could add the following shell script to your crontab:%0a>>pre%3c%3c%0a   echo Making backup of PmWiki...%0a   cp -r pmwiki pmwiki.bak; # Make backup, overwriting old one.%0a   echo Downloading latest version...%0a   svn export svn://pmwiki.org/pmwiki/tags/latest pmwiki --force%0a>>%3c%3c%0a%0a(Save it as @@pmwiki-upgrade.sh@@ or whatever.)  %0aThe backup creation step could be elaborated upon somewhat, to give incremental backups for example, or at least a timestamp.%0a%0a
