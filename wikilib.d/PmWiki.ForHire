text=(:Summary:consultants, contractors, developers and designers for hire:)%0a(:title Consultants, Contractors, Developers and Designers for Hire:)%0a(:keywords hire pay fee consultant designer developer contractor PmWiki:)%0a%0aSo, you want to use PmWiki for your site, but you want someone else to install and configure it for you, maybe help with design and content, maybe just be there if you need help, and you are willing to pay money.%0a%0aSome others who do this are at [[PmWiki/PmWikiUsers]].%0a%0a!!Fine Print%0a*Anybody can add themselves to this page. Buyer beware.%0a**Not all good consultants contribute visibly to the PmWiki community, but you can get a feel for those who do by their contributions to the user [[PmWiki/MailingLists]] and by searching for their name on this site.%0a%0a*The PmWiki software is Open Source. It is free. The consultants charge for their time and expertise.%0a**Pm has invested a lot of time in creating the program, maintaining and upgrading it, hosting the PmWiki site and Newsgroup, helping other programmers and developers, and making sure the program is the wonderful product it is. The PmWiki community also contributes. It is only fair that people who use it to make their own jobs easier contribute, either financially or with time. A comparable commercial program would cost a fair amount. You should discuss this with any potential consultant.%0a%0a*Other%0a**Some contractors have reduced rates for charities.%0a**It is not necessary to be in the same city, but a similar time zone is often convenient.%0a**You can also advertise your needs on the user [[PmWiki/MailingLists]].%0a**Also see [[PmWiki/PmWikiUsers]].%0a**Domain registration and site hosting may or may not be included. Again, something to discuss.%0a**[[PmWiki/WebHosts]] has host services on which you can install PmWiki.%0a%0a!!List of Consultants%0a%0a(:table border=1 style="font-size:90%25;":)%0a(:cellnr:)'''Name'''\\%0a'''Contact'''%0a(:cell:)'''Client size, Price range'''%0a(:cell:)'''Location'''%0a(:cell:)'''Other'''%0a%0a(:cellnr:)[[Profiles|Profile name]]\\%0a[[mailto:sample@example.com|sample@example.com]]%0a(:cell:)$xx - $xx\\%0ax-page sites for xxxx%0a(:cell:)City or timezone%0a(:cell:)Specializing in xxxx See some of our work at http://www.example.com, http://www.other.example.com%0a%0a(:cellnr:)[[http://grype.ca|Grype Solutions]]\\%0a%0a[[mailto:projects@grype.ca|projects-at-grype-dot-ca]]%0a(:cell:)%0a* Please contact us for a price quote.%0a* Usually between $100 - $500%0a(:cell:)Ottawa, Canada%0a(:cell:)We specialize in PmWiki customization.
