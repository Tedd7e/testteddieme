You can receive an invoice and may be able to deduct it as expenses.%0a%0a!! Why?%0a%0aPmWiki is open source and available free of charge, however the "free" time for its development, maintenance and support is limited. %0a%0a[[http://www.pmwiki.org/petko|Petko Yotov]] has been the PmWiki core developer, release manager and webmaster since [[https://www.pmwiki.org/pipermail/pmwiki-users/2009-January/053219.html|2009]], and has been publishing addons, updating documentation and providing support since [[https://www.pmwiki.org/search-ml.php?action=search&q=5ko+from%253A5ko+until%253A2006|2006]]. Financial contributions allow Petko to dedicate more time and effort to the project, reduce other "real" (paid) work and still take care of family, rent, and food. Payments also reduce the tensions among family, work, and PmWiki and reduce burnout on the project.%0a%0a%25note%25 Please do not feel obligated to make payments: you can always get PmWiki and support for free. This page exists to allow people or companies who '''want''' to contribute to do it legally and easily.%0a%0a!! Details%0aPayments can be made via Credit Card, via a PayPal account, via SEPA bank transfer, and you will receive a receipt or an invoice.%0a* '''Credit or Debit cards''' or '''PayPal accounts''' can be used to make payments.%0a* '''SEPA bank transfer''' may be convenient in Europe. Please contact mailto:5ko@5ko.fr for details.%0a%0aWhile development, documentation, maintenance, communications, testing, and a host of other costs vary considerably according to the activity and complexity, below are some rough estimates on what your payments can allow Petko to perform:%0a%0a* 320 EUR = a day's work, eg. Core development (planning, researching, coding, testing, committing, documenting).%0a* 320 EUR = pmwiki.org website maintenance for 1 month (reviewing edits/uploads, reverting spam & vandalism, fixing broken pages, cleanup, configuration).%0a* 160 EUR = tech intelligence gathering for 1 month (threats, strategies).%0a* 160 EUR = fix and document 1 medium bug, or 2 simple bugs, or review & update 4 addons for PHP compatibility.%0a* 480 EUR = create a simple mobile-friendly skin, or an average complexity addon.%0a* 40 EUR = reply to support or development questions (4-5 simple/short replies, or 1 long reply, or 1 reply requiring research/testing/sample code). English is Petko's ''third'' language so writing takes some time.%0a%0a!! Statistics%0a%0a|| class=nicetable%0a||!Contributed by Petko   ||! '^a^'2007||!

Companies from Bulgaria, France, Germany, UK, and USA have been able to deduct these payments. Please confer with your tax advisor on this subject.  If you use PmWiki for business purposes, such a payment may be an eligible business expense.
