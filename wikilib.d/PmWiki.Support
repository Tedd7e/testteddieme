Content and File Review Services [[#review]]%0a!!! Content Review%0aLess experienced editors sometimes make mistakes while editing the wiki pages. A Content Reviewer is an experienced editor who works in the shadow towards improving the wiki. A Reviewer reviews pages and fixes any errors it finds in style, markup, or typos. Reviewers don't modify factual content written by other editors, and try not to bother them: they wait for the editor to have finished editing the page before modifying it.%0a%0a!!!File Review%0aLess experienced editors sometimes upload huge pictures or document files with incorrect extensions, for example PDF or DOCX files with the DOC extension. Such files may be impossible to open on many computers and devices. The File Reviewer is an experienced administrator who reviews and fixes uploaded files including renaming files to their actual extension, fixing any links in the pages to the files, and optimizing uploaded pictures, for example when a smaller and lighter photo would provide the same information. The original files replaced by the Reviewer are not lost, they stay "hidden" in the upload directories and can be recovered/restored if needed.%0a%0aExample cost for this service on a community wiki with medium activity: 120€/month WikiGnome, 120€/month FileGnome.%0a%0a%25rfloat%25 [[#top|top]]%0a!!Migration Services [[#migration]]%0a%0aWe help you '''migrate your wikis to a different hosting provider or plan'''. This includes, when necessary, the Apache or other server configuration, .htaccess or CleanUrls, the PHP configuration, the filename recovery, eg. containing diacritical or accented characters.%0a%0aExample cost for a medium-sized wiki: 400€ one time fee.%0a%0a%25rfloat%25 [[#top|top]]%0a!!Backup, Restore and Mirror Services [[#backup_restore]]%0a%0a!!!Backup%0a%0aWe offer an automated nightly backup service. We maintain snapshots – directories/folders with the full content of your files – for the last 2 months (62 full snapshots). You can connect to the backup server via FTP and download any program file, stylesheet, page, picture or uploaded document from the previous days.%0a%0aNightly, the backup servers connect to your hosting space and download a snapshot from your files. You receive an e-mail confirming the snapshot creation, its size and listing the files that were added, modified or deleted compared to the previous snapshot.%0a%0aThe system is highly optimized for Wiki installations, it only downloads actual content and program files, excludes temporary files, cache, thumbnail and index files that are automatically rebuilt, and deleted draft pages. Deleted pages and deleted uploads are included in the backups and can be recovered. The system downloads only newly added or modified files, keeping the bandwidth usage low.%0a%0aYou can access your snapshots at any time on our backup server via FTP. Our second disk space, in a different datacenter, is only accessible to us. The third backup server is on our internal network and is not accessible via internet.%0a%0aOur backup cluster consists of hardware and software installations of different types so the risk for hardware or software failure at the same time is very low.%0a%0aExample prices: 60€/month for 1GBytes of disk space (latest snapshot). Note that this is the price of our human, manual work (installation, daily maintenance of the backup servers, human review of the nightly backup logs and reaction in case of need).%0a%0a!!! Restore%0a%0aThe Backup service allows '''you''' to recover and restore any file by yourself. We also offer a Restore service so that '''we recover and restore the whole wiki''' or individual files for you.%0a%0aExample prices (in addition to the backup fee above):%0a%0a* One time full restoration from a snapshot for a medium-sized wiki: 400€.%0a** If on a different hosting provider, +100€%0a* Subscription for a large wiki with 50-100 wikigroups: 50€/month. Occasional recovery of individual files, or full restoration and migration are included in this subscription.%0a%0a!!! Mirror%0a%0aWe can offer a Mirror service where we maintain a functional read-only wiki with your content from the latest backup. If your website address is www.example.com, we maintain the mirror backup.example.com on our own hosting plans. In case of a failure of the main wiki your users can continue to use the read-only backup wiki.%0a%0aThis service can be provided for 15€/month (a backup service subscription is required).%0a%0a%25rfloat%25 [[#top|top]]%0a!!
