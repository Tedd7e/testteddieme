text=(:Summary: Ask your questions about PmWiki here, after checking the [[documentation index]] and [[FAQ]]:)%0a%0aThis is a page where you can ask questions about PmWiki.%0aYou will need to count on someone coming along and answering your question, so please be patient.%0a%0aA quicker, more effective way to ask a question is to join the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]] and '''''send your question to the list.'''''%0aUnfortunately answers to the list do not always get posted here, perhaps you can help keep PmWiki up to date by making sure your answer is added here or elsewhere in the documentation.%0a%0aSee also [[How to get assistance]].%0aIn particular please try to [[PmWiki/HowToGetAssistance#reproduce | reproduce]] the issue in a [[Test/]] page.%0a>>faq%3c%3c%0a%0aQ: Is this the right place to post my question?%0a%0aA: It might be.  Posting to the [[mailing list(s)]] would work better, but adding it here may get you an answer. Make sure your question doesn't appear on the [[FAQ | PmWiki FAQ]] page first. You might also try [[Site/search]]ing pmwiki.org to find an answer.%0a%0aA: %25note%25 If your question is about a specific [[Documentation(Index)]] page or [[Cookbook/]]/[[Skins/]] recipe please ask it on the recipe-Talk page (if it doesn't exist, just create it).%0a%0a(:searchbox:)%0a%0aIf you still can't find what you need to know and you don't want to use the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]], then post your question on this page.%0a%0aOnce your question has been answered, it may be moved to the [[FAQ Candidate]] page or even the [[FAQ | PmWiki FAQ]] page, so if it disappears look for it on those two pages.%0a----%0aQ: How can I edit the group name?%0a%0aA: %25block Py%25 You can change the title of the group homepage, as in %25pmhlt%25 [@(:title New name:)@], see [[Page directives]], or you can install a recipe and set a [[Cookbook/group title]]. Or you can create a new [[WikiGroup]] and place your pages there. %0a%0aA: %25block Py%25 This is not a simple operation, if you already have pages in the old group, you could rename the page files in your wiki.d folder and update any links to the old group. Do this carefully, the new filenames need to be in a format expected by PmWiki otherwise the files may be unreachable / invisible to PmWiki. --[[~Petko]] @2022-08-28T13:49:40Z %0a%0a----%0a''Looks like I'm the first one adding to this in nearly a year! ''%0a%0aQ: I'm trying to decide whether to set up a new instance of PmWiki on a self-hosted NAS, or to migrate an existing instance.%0aWhat's stopping me from just migrating the older one are things like changes in IP address.%0aWhen I look at a page from the old instance, I see something like this:%0a%0a--> version=pmwiki-2.2.130 ordered=1 urlencoded=1%0a--> agent=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0 Waterfox/56.3%0a--> author=%0a--> charset=UTF-8%0a--> csum=%0a--> ctime=1596706067%0a--> host=2.26.58.171%0a%0aThis last line, the host IP, is the previous IP, not the one for my NAS.%0aSo I worry that simply copying the installation folder from one server to another won't work, if all the pages refer to some other IP address. %0aThe documentation about [[PmWiki.BackupAndRestore]] is a bit sparse in this regard. It seems that it's referring to restoration onto the same server. %0aSo, I can simplify my question: can an instance be copied across from one server to another, provided the folder structure remains intact? [[~dp]] October 05, 2020, at 11:59 PM%0a%0aA: %25Py%25 The "host" page attribute is the IP address of the last editor, not of the server, see [[PageFileFormat]]. It is not used to make links, stored for reference, for example to be able to block a user or review the raw server logs for activity from that person. To answer your question, yes, mostly. Move your entire installation (pmwiki.php, scripts, cookbook, local, wikilib.d, wiki.d, uploads), and review local/config.php and other scripts you may have modified in the local and cookbook directories to see if some local configuration in that file refers to the old IP address or the old server name, you may need to update it, notably $ScriptUrl, $FarmPubDirUrl, $PubDirUrl. --[[~Petko]] October 06, 2020, at 06:20 AM%0a%0a----%0aQ: I manually purged hundreds of spam files from the wiki.d directory.  Is there a way to have AllRecentChanges regenerate itself so it no longer shows these purged files but continues to show all the others?  (I'd like to see just real changes made by our group on this page and not what has been purged.)%0a%0aA: Try Cookbook:RebuildRC. --[[~Petko]] November 25, 2019, at 02:27 PM%0a%0aThanks!!  This worked great when I used it with this string:%0a%0a$RebuildRCPattern = '*.*,-PmWiki*.*,-Site*.*,-Category.*,-*.RecentChanges,-*.AllRecentChanges';%0a%0a%0a----%0aQ: How to set a custom bookmarklet favicon (not the default website favicon) in Firefox?%0a%0aA: I'm not sure there is a way to change the icon of a specific bookmark different from the icon for the domain. [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/favicon-customizer/|This]] or [[https://youtu.be/7u2jBitDcho|this]] may work, or not. This is something not specifically related to PmWiki though -- maybe ask at some forum(s) dedicated to Firefox? --[[~Petko]] May 22, 2019, at 10:39 AM%0a----%0aQ: How to put large preformatted text into a scroll-able area.%0a%0aComing from wikimedia (and as such a PmWiki noob) i'm probably going the wrong way about this but it is totally unclear to me how one manage to put some (pre-formatted) text into a box. fwiw,  i've read the documentation many times and the closest i seem to be able to get is something like this:%0a[@%0a>>frame indent color=green bgcolor=blue font-family=monospace height=auto max-height=200px width=550px overflow=scroll padding-botttom=10px border=3px%3c%3c%0ahundreds of lines of pre formatted text that contains long lines (about 200-500 characters width) and can not be wrapped.%0a>>%3c%3c%0a@]%0a%0aNo matter what i try, the overflow attributes keeps being removed, which results in display havoc :-)%0a[[~SomeNoob]] May 15, 2019, at 06:29 AM%0a%0aA: %25Py%25 Overflow is indeed not supported out of the box, but you can add it with such a line in config.php: @@$WikiStyleCSS[] = 'overflow';@@ then it should work. Alternatively, or in addition, especially if you reuse these styles you can [[LocalCustomizations|create a file pub/css/local.css]] and place there any custom styles for a "class" like @@.monoscroll { font-family: monospace; overflow:scroll; [other styles] } @@ then in the wiki code just use the classname like [@>>frame indent monoscroll%3c%3c@]. Or, if you include the "frame" and "indent" styles into the @@.monoscroll@@ class, simply [@>>monoscroll%3c%3c@]. If PmWiki doesn't recognize a keyword as a [[WikiStyle(s)]], it considers it a CSS classname. --[[~Petko]] May 15, 2019, at 07:21 AM%0a%0a-> Thank you very much for the quick reply @Petko. Works like a charm and thereby you've included 3 additional answers on (followup) questions that i (still) had. Saves me from asking those separately :-) [[~SomeNoob]] May 15, 2019, at 08:23 AM%0a----%0aQ: How can I make a reaction to wrong password input? I have the readonly site with [@?action=login@] link on every it's page. If user types the wrong password (''wrong'' could mean that there is not such password in config.php OR that user access level was not changed after login attempt), I want to show him a message about it. Is it possible in any way? The problem is that after user loggin in PmWiki makes redirect to [@$pagename@] with no params. [[~Finar]] April 22, 2019, at 05:20 PM%0a%0aA: %25Py%25 There is no wrong password for PmWiki, just wrong password for a particular action at a particular page. When a user types any password, PmWiki remembers it. If the user tries to access a protected page or action, PmWiki tries all passwords the user knows (typed within the current session), and if one of these is sufficient for the page and action, the user is permitted to access, otherwise the authentication form is shown. Instead of ?action=login you can use ?action=edit. Alternatively see [[Conditional markup]] for either [@(:if authid:)@] or [@(:if auth edit:)@] which you could place in a sidebar, topbar or in Site.PageActions. That way users can see a change in the interface after the ?action=login form. --[[~Petko]] May 08, 2019, at 08:59 AM%0a%0aA:%25Py%25 Or, you can try this in config.php: @@ $HandleAuth['login'] = 'edit'; @@ --[[~Petko]] May 09, 2019, at 06:27 AM%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is it safe to name a group and/or a page with a single letter (e.g. A/A, A/B, etc.)? [-([[~Frank]] April 30, 2018, at 10:55 PM)-]%0a%0a%25Py%25 Yes: A.A, A.B, A.2 are all fine. Note that in the default installation a WikiGroup name cannot start with, or be a single digit like in 1.1, this is controlled by the variable $GroupPattern. --[[~Petko]] May 01, 2018, at 01:15 AM%0a%0aThanks. [-([[~Frank]] May 01, 2018, at 01:33 AM)-]%0a----%0aQ: I've set $ScriptUrl and $PubDirUrl to https://example.com, but PmWiki redirects to https://www.example.com. I can't find this redirect anywhere in the config, .htaccess file or in pmwiki.php. Where do I disable this obnoxious behaviour?%0a%0a%25Py%25 Try a simple HTML file like https://example.com/test.html. If it still redirects to the "www." subdomain, it has nothing to do with PmWiki, this is either a DNS redirect (sometimes a TXT record) or an Apache configuration (in httpd.conf or another config file). Check the documentation at your hosting and DNS provider(s). --[[~Petko]] April 12, 2018, at 09:38 AM%0a%0aThanks, it turns out somebody messed with the domain config, yeah. I was pulling my hair out because I know the apache config is correct (and I can't access the domain control panel). Thanks!%0a----%0aQ: In older versions of pmwiki (e.g. 2.2.91) it was no problem, to create a page with name starting with small letter (e.g. [@ [[Main/test]] @]. If I do this now in newer version (2.2.102) it does not work. The system trys to create a page like this: cb_toupperbcb_toupperoupperest. How can I get it work? Thanks for your help. Astrid, October 19, 2017%0a%0a%25Py%25 Make sure you have updated all files, especially pmwiki.php and the files in the scripts directory. Also, and this is very important, you must not rename pmwiki.php to index.php, index.php needs to contain simply [@%3c?php include_once("pmwiki.php");@] otherwise you may forget to update it and may run an older, incompatible, or vulnerable version. --[[~Petko]] October 19, 2017, at 03:55 AM%0a%0aThanx. The pmwiki, where the error appears, I installed fresh from downloading the tgz and putting the german language on it. I did not rename the pmwiki.php, I did it with the include.%0a%0a%25Py%25 It does work here: [[Main/test]] (PHP 5.2) and also on my home server (PHP 7.1) so I assume there is something different in your installation. 2.2.102 doesn't have a cb_toupper reference, so either you run 2.2.103-104, or on 102 you have some newer local customization that requires 103 or later. Does the German installation include custom $MakePageNamePatterns variables? --[[~Petko]] October 19, 2017, at 08:45 AM%0a%0aThanx. [[Main/test]] is working for me. I updated to 104 with German. Now it is working with pagenames beginning with small letters for me too. Thanx. :)%0a%0a----%0aQ: I'm very happy with PmWiki's syntax. But with hundreds of pages sometimes it's hard to find out the correct name of a page I'd like to set a link to. Is there a possibility to create something like a popup where I can select an internal page from a list instead of typing the link? DokuWiki for example has this built-in. I could create something with Fox, but perhaps there is an easier way. Thanks for help. Daniel, October 3, 2016%0aA: You can do it yourself. I will describe one possible way (I used in my project):%0a* edit [[Site.EditForm]] adding some [[PmWiki/PageLists|pagelist]] which will generate the list of links you want to be on hand. Actually this is 80%25 of the goal, if you are happy with ctrl+c/ctrl+v, you can stop here. If you want get more pretty result, then continue;%0a* use some CSS code for styling this list;%0a* use some jQuery solution to make this list of links clickable.%0a[[~Finar]] August 14, 2018, at 03:44 PM%0a----%0aQ: After copying one complete wiki from one server to another the wiki works great with one exception: GroupHeaders and Footers are not shown anymore. There are only two things that changed at the new server: It is a Unix server (Windows before) and the authentication runs via LDAP. I tried almost everything: Setting new access rights, creating new groups and pages, but PMWiki won't show any header or footer. What reasons could there be? August 31, 2016%0a%0aA:  Hi, now I resolved the problem. It was about lower/upper case letters, which is important to unix, but not to windows. All my header an footer files were named "Groupheader" and "Groupfooter", while the pmwiki.php needs "GroupHeader" and "GroupFooter". So it was very easy to fix!%0a%0a----%0aQ: How do I create a link to firefox "about:addons" ? Augst 9, 2016%0a%0aA: You can add an intermap prefix, see [[InterMap]], however most browsers will not follow such links: about:addons. %0a%0a----%0aQ: I Need to Change the way, the form-Buttons work (Save, Save and edit, Preview, Cancel). I allready deleted the preview button, because I don't Need it. For the save and cancel button: They should perform as they do but instead of linking to the edited site, they should link to a defined site (on this one, I want to write something like this: "Your Input has been saved" - so no linking to the edited site). Please help.%0a%0aA: Found the answer myself on [[PmWiki/EditVariables]] !%0a%0a----%0aQ: I just installed pmwiki through GoDaddy. When I try to save an edit, or enter a password to get into the administration site, instead of taking me to the appropriate webpage, I get a message that says that the server sent no data. It also says, "Error code: ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE" Does anyone know why this would happen? This happens every time I try to save an edit or enter a password. "I have the same issue...is there anyone who can explain this - DR"%0a%0aA: Recent PmWiki versions (2.2.56 and newer) should work fine on GoDaddy hosting plans. If the problem appears only when a Cookbook recipe is enabled, we may be able to help updating the recipe too.%0a%0a----%0aQ: I'd like to define links within Site/InterMap using a dynamic method based on what pages currently exist in two groups.  I was intending to use a custom page list template (and still would like to) however, entries only seem to count if they're entered manually.  I'd hate to have to manually copy and paste the results for the links to update.  How can I automate this?%0a%0aA: Perhaps you can define PmWiki:InterMap links in your configuration file instead of on the InterMap page. Also, although it's not dynamic, you can partially automate any copy and paste chore by generating the markup you want to paste using a custom pagelist. Use [%25%25@ and @%25%25] tactfully to ensure that the output is markup.%0a----%0a%0aQ: Is there a way to integrate Matomo (formerly Piwik) - web analytics to PmWiki sites? (https://matomo.org/)%0a%0aA: You can put the JavaScript code (and the noscript image URL) in $HTMLFooterFmt['matomo']%0a----%0aQ: Is there a way to link to a local pdf document such that the link in PmWiki opens it in the browser?%0a%0aI am using OSX Safari.  If I type a link [@file:///Users/.../file.pdf@] into Safari, it will open the file.  If however I add that link to a Wiki page (web-based, but accessed through Safari on the same machine), it will not.  Is there a way?  Many thanks, [[Profiles/Conrad]], 23 August 2012%0a----%0aQ: Is it possible to have blocklists by group?%0a%0aI want to block URLs on Talk pages which are world editable, but allow them in Main pages which are editable only by @contributors. It seems intuitive that Talk.Blocklist should be the blocklist for the Talk group, but (as the documentation does say) all blocklist pages are used. I tried this conditional in Talk.Blocklist%0a%0a[@%0a(:if equal "{*$Group}" "Talk" :)%0ablock:/[^\w\\]href\b/%0a(:ifend:)%0a@]%0a%0abut this continued to block all URLs in all groups.%0a%0a>>Py%3c%3c%0aYou can reset the $BlocklistPages for the Talk group. In the file plwiki/local/Talk.php, add such a line: [@%0a  $BlocklistPages = array('SiteAdmin.Blocklist', 'Talk.Blocklist');%0a@]%0aYou may also want to enable Blocklist only for the Talk group, in that case, set the line @@ $EnableBlocklist = 1; @@ in Talk.php, and remove it from config.php. If the Talk.php file doesn't exist, create it with a first line containing [@%3c?php@] then the other lines below, see [[LocalCustomizations]]. --[[~Petko]] April 15, 2012, at 10:33 AM%0a>>%3c%3c%0a----%0aQ: I am trying to create a link to a different port on the same machine as the wiki, where I have a different service running (like: [=https://name.tld:8000/=]); with a ":" and port number before the trailing "/".

When I click the PmWiki icon on the top left, I am redirected to the Main page. There is no problem about that! However, when  I click the Search button on the top right or on the bottom of the page, I am redirected to the Search page corresponding to the Brazilian translation, which has a different SideBar from the one where I built all our pages. I mean, all our pages were created based on the main Site/SideBar and not on the PmWikiPtBr. I have tried to redirect the Brazilian Portuguese Search engine to the Main page and was lucky, (but I fear I did something not the way it should be). What I did exactly was: I changed lines 28 and 55 that have the codes\\\%0a[@%3ca href='{$ScriptUrl}/$[{$SiteGroup}/Search]'>$[Search]%3c/a>%3c/div>@]\\\%0ato\\\%0a[@%3ca href='http://192.../pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.Search'>$[Search]%3c/a>%3c/div> %3cdiv id='wikifoot'>@]\\\%0aon the pmwiki.tmpl.

The translation has to be performed in a translation memory system (TMS - basically, a specialized database system, if you've never heard of it).%0a%0aIdeally, this means getting the database to import the Pmwiki page source, extract the visible text from all the formatting, let us translate it, and then export Pmwiki page source again with all the formatting intact but the translations inserted in place of the original text.%0a%0aThe main problem here is that no TMS (to my knowledge) understands Pmwiki syntax, and the project does not justify programming a custom filter for this purpose. A feasible workaround would be to export the page source from Pmwiki as XML and write a filter for that TMS' usually have pretty good XML support which would only need to be configured right.%0a%0aTherefore my question: Do XML filters for Pmwiki exist that preserve all the formatting? Or are there other filters that may be useful (e.g., Word), i.e., that export all formatting so that it can be imported again with the translation?

When I started my wiki, I encouraged editors to insert what I call "pre-links" in articles. For example, an editor creating an article about "Bob" will go ahead and link references to "Mary" or "Joe" even if no articles exist on Mary or Joe. My reasoning was that other editors would notice these links and future articles would be encouraged as a result. This is very confusing to a common non-editor/reader, though, whose only interest is browsing the site. They click one of the links with the ? mark beside it, and can't understand why they're getting a prompt for a password. I would like to insert a message, "This article has not been written yet. Please check back later" and also have a way for editors to click from THAT page, submit their password, and proceed to create the new page. For the moment, I've asked editors to stop inserting pre-links until this can be sorted out.%0a%0aA: The page that is displayed when you are prompted for a password is [[Site.AuthForm]]. You could take the contents of the AuthForm page and place them in a new page, are change the AuthForm page to have the message you require, and a link to the new page (and a link to where you came from).%0a%0a----%0aQ: How can I limit the pages users can see?%0a-> When I browse to my pmwiki on (for example) [@https://%3cip>/pmwiki/pub/skins@], people can see the contents of that directory. Should I put empty index.html's in those directories? (any specifics I have to watch out for?)%0a%0aA: Putting index.html in these directories is a good solution. The approach PmWiki uses is to add a .htaccess file to its directories. You can copy this into all the directories you wish to restrict the contents to, but additionally you could enable the access to index.html (which could redirect to, say, your homepage).%0a%0aQ: When I browse to [@https://%3cip>/pmwiki/sdofhaewh98awe@] (i.e. garbage) I always get some default page.%0aWhich default page is this and can I change it? If people type a wrong URL I would want them to see nothing. (would this interfere with creating new wiki's from non-existing links?)%0a%0aA: The default page is [[Site.PageNotFound]].%0aWhat do you mean by nothing - do you mean you don't want to navigate away from the page you are at?%0aAfter you are making a request, something has to be displayed?%0a%0aIdeally I would likie to show a 404-not-found when a user types a URL that doesn't exist. When I delete the Site.PageNotFound file I still get some empty page that contains my sidebar and tabmenu (simpletab skin).%0a%0aThankyou!%0aAugust 6th 2007%0a%0a----%0a%0aQ: PmWiki seems to be unable to read the '-config.php-' file.%0aShould I change '-permissions-' to '-"/local"-' folder to '-755-'?

By the way the installation is in a free hosting service and they place ads in the pages (if it is of any importance). Nikos%0a%0aProblem solved: I should have deleted the "'-# -' " before an option.

New question: Why all the different file-extensions instead of making them all something like .PmWiki and .Site files?%0a%0aHere's the thing: The browser based file manager I was using couldn't read all of your files because it didn't have the necessary fileextensions added. And who can blame it. You have a load of these weird fileextensions seemingly for no reason. Why is it that you have to have a load of different files like PmWiki.WikiWord, PmWiki.WikiPages and Site.AuthUser? Why couldn't you just make two new filetypes instead of 108!? You could just make .PmWiki and .Site files, making the files mentioned above become WikiWord.PmWiki, WikiPages.Pmwiki and AuthUser.Site.%0aOr maybe they could even be textfiles?.. I guess I'm way too unexperienced in this area to know what I'm talking about, but it just seems like such a weird thing to do seeing as most other wikis do just fine without it, and maaany people out there prefer to make use of browserbased filemanagers. Isn't there some way to work around making hundreds of new fileextensions?%0a[[~Aray]] April 17, 2007, at 23:44%0a%0aThey aren't extensions in the conventional way.  The files are wiki pages, where the filename is each page's name in a GroupName.PageName format.  I don't think there's a way around that. --[[~Hagan(Fox)]]%0a%0a----%0a%0aQ: Hi! Why is e.g. my local folder empty when I view it in the filemanager (www.110mb.com) and all I can see is a .htaccess file in there when I check it out on the comp?%0aI am quite new in everything that has to do with web-developing. I have managed to establish this webpage, and now I wanted to give your wiki a try. I've installed other wikis with success, but this one is giving me some problems. All I can see in the zip is these .htaccess files, where I thought there should be various other files... Anyways, I upload the zip, I unzip the folder, I create the index.php, and the page kinda works. But on pretty much everything except the HomePage link, there are these questionmarks attached for some reason. Every link that's got a questionmark attached has no content. I just can't figure out what's wrong :(%0a%0aWill I get slapped for my extreme lack of knowledge now? :o%0a%0a'''Edit:''' Oh, I realized that those questionmarks might be ''supposed'' to be there, so I'll add this then: Editing doesn't work, it just reloads the page. The same thing happens if I try to access the recent changes, or the search for instance. In short: Nothing works!\\%0a[[~Aray]] April 15, 2007, at 02.10 AM%0a%0aA: The question marks indicate a link to a wiki page that doesn't exist.%0a%0aYou are correct that there should be various files in most of the directories, although the [@local/@] and [@cookbook/@] directories are empty except for a .htaccess file.  Make sure you have installed all of the files in [@scripts/@] and [@wikilib.d/@] .  --[[~Hagan(Fox)]]%0a%0a'''Edit2:''' That's the problem. The wikilib.d folder is just stuffed with files like .authform and .pageactions, and the browserbased filemanager I'm using can't seem to read these. Anywow, if I simply upload the whole zip (pmwiki-2.1.27), unzip it and run the pmwiki.php file, that page with the questionmarks is loaded. If I take a look at my filemanager after doing this, I see that a new folder called wiki.d is created, and it's got one visible file in it called ".flock".%0aI still can't figure out what's causing this problem :(%0a%0aA: try reviewing and following carefully the [[installation]] instructions.%0a%0a----%0a%0aQ: Hello there!

But all that happened was, that the picture disappeared and was replaced by a textlink "quotes.gif" (so the link was not transformed into a picture). So I tried [=$SkinDirUrl/quotes.gif=]... and I am soooo close: now I get the right URL depending on the skin I am using, but the problem is, that it is still a textlink. So again, the picture is not shown (do you know what I mean... difficult to describe, my English is not good enough). Well.. now I either need a clue how I can transform textlinks into pictures (usually this happens automatically :( ), if the URL is correct, or another solution.

Does AllRecentChanges objectively have that kind of impact on performance, or am I imagining things?

You don't need to have the files in the wiki-files, not even on the same server. Just add [@http://yourfile-URL.ext@] and it will be converted to a link. When your extention e.g. is *.pdf, then - depending on the browser-settings of your users - a hit will either start a download, or will open and can then be saved manually. You can use [@[[http://www.yourfile-URL.ext|My Downloadname]]@] to give the link an alternative name.%0a-%3c[[~Marvin]] October 28, 2006, at 01:33 PM%0a----%0aQ: (October 24, 2006) And once again, I really searched like maniac but couldn't find anything. Is it possible to edit the AllRecentChanges so that it lists page titles instead of filenames?%0a-> I tried to edit pmwiki.php (in RecentChangesFmt I added [=|{$titlespaced}=] to the links, but with only the effect that editing the recent-changes file didn't work anymore... which happend every time I changed ANYTHING there... e.g. I tried to remove the ":" after the author's name with the same bad result. Where can I change this? When I edit the Site.AllRecentChanges all I can do is remove entries, but there is no :pagelist: variable or sth.%0a-%3c A very puzzled [[~Marvin]] October 24, 2006, at 12:45 PM%0a%0aA: I'd be wary of making any changes to pmwiki.php  In general, you should be able to make most changes by adding entries to your config.php.  In this case, I think what you are looking for is the $RecentChangesFmt variable.  Click on the word $RecentChangesFmt and it will take you to the page where that variable is briefly described with the code to enter in config.php  I don't have any experience with that, so I can't say much more.  (But I got there with a search for "AllRecentChanges"  If you want a more targeted search on PmWiki.org, try using the following page that I setup: [[PmWiki/Search]]  It isn't part of the PmWiki distribution, but its a good resource for search PmWiki.org for documentation, recipes and PITS issues.%0a%0aQ: LAYOUT VARIABLES! *bangs head on table* I really searched the whole wiki here!! Thanks, Pico, I will have a try (and bookmark the page!).%0aQ: (2) :( doesn't work.. it doesn't overwrite but add after the normal lines. And there are no links, but everything looks like when you post it with [@[@ @] I copied the code that is shown in the LayoutVariables page.%0a%0aA:(2) Yup, I tried it and see what you meant.  Looking at the code, it makes no sense that the format markup ends with a pair of escapes, and in reversed order too ("[@ =] [=@]").  When I removed those, it works fine.  But note that the screwed up entries that were created with the prior format will persist, and the open escape may cause subsequent entries for that page to be appended to the existing entry.   Test with changes to a different page to confirm that the new format works.  You may have to edit or delete the existing RecentChanges / AllRecentChanges to get rid of the screwed up entries.%0a%0aOn a related note, if you are using the beta series of PmWiki the $RecentChangesFmt may have to be revised for the group specific RecentChanges pages to work, but simply adding an asterisk didn't fix it for me.  I'll post to Pm and the list for help.%0a%0aQ: (3) Wheee! I think I had deleted a ' when I first tried to delete the [=[= =], because the whole page was broken then.. but now it works (nearly) fine:%0a[@[=$RecentChangesFmt['$SiteGroup.AllRecentChanges'] =%0a  '* [[$Group.$Name|$Title]] - $CurrentTime $[by] $AuthorLink ([=$ChangeSummary=])';%0a$RecentChangesFmt['$Group.RecentChanges'] =%0a  '* [[$Group/$Name|$Title]] - $CurrentTime $[by] $AuthorLink ([=$ChangeSummary=])';=]@]%0aJust one tiny thing: The changes are sorted by date, but the older entries stay on top and the newer ones are added BELOW. Is there a possibility to change this, so that the newest changes are always on top?

The pages are named Category.Pagename. I don't know MediaWiki, but if they also have a file for every page, then it would do to simply rename the files (isnt't that easily possible with a program like irfanview?) [[~Marvin]] October 22, 2006, at 02:30 PM%0a%0a----%0aQ: (October 14, 2006) I'd like the search to find only pages with the searched word in the TITLE and if no title is set, in the pagename.%0a-> So that the content is not included. If I type in "marvin" I want it to find the page "Vells Marvin" and "Marvins wife", but not a page named "Children" and the content "These are Marvins children". And if no result is found, I'd like to have a link to a page with the "normal" search as it is now, where all pages are included. Like "no result for Marvin found, would you like to search page contents as well, then enter your Search here". Is this possible? I thought of putting fmt=#title in the search-code, but didn't know where... and I don't have any clues of php.%0a%0aYou don't need to know php.  You can do this easily for searching page names.  You should be able to enter "name=*Marvin*" into a searchbox to return all pages where the string "Marvin" appears anywhere in the title.  (Try it on this site with, say "name=*Page*" which should return pages with the string "page" anywhere within the page name.  Now, to take this further and setup specialized searchboxes, or results, you can create searchboxes, or searchresults, that supply some parameters, such as "name=*Marvin*"  Take a look at the (non-distrubted) search page that I added at [[PmWiki/Search]].  For more information, look at the distributed documentation at [[PmWiki/PageLists]].%0a%0aNow, if you want to do this for page "titles," I'm not sure what the answer is right now.  Pagelists support specifying pages using the "name" parameter, and support wildcards within that parameter, but I do not think that titles are supported parameters and, if they were, the question remains whether they would support wildcards.  But lots of changes are being introduced with the new beta versions of PmWiki 2.2.0-beta# with respect to pagelist and support for more flexible page text variables that can supplement the existing page variables (such as name and title).%0a%0aQ: sorry, but I still can't find a solution for what I want... I want the search to find the titles automatically... or pagenames.. that is not so much the problem.%0a-> But I don't like it that my users have to write name=*sth*, because everyone usually uses a search by simply typing in the word you are searching for (seems to be the google-generation ;o) )\\%0a[@(:searchresults fmt=#title:)@] doesn't work, I tried this... I still get all pages that contain the word :(  So I think I have to write sth. into the [@(:searchbox:)@] or in my template, if I want to change the behaviour of the Searchbar on top of my site. \\%0aProbably someone can have a look at [@thronfolgekrieg.szandor.de@] to see what I mean.%0a%0aA: Marvin,  first of all, please be careful when you write about wiki markup because when you spell it out it PmWiki will try to interpret it unless you are careful to "escape" the markup (with [=[@=] and [=@]=]).  The content and ordering of this page got pretty strange and eventually I tracked it down to your references to [@(:searchresults:)@] and [@(:searchbox:)@] and, even though they did not include the closing portions [@:)@], your smileys eventually kicked in.%0a%0aAs for the underlying question, there is no really easy answer, but it can be done.  Maybe the easiest thing to do right now is to refer you to the thread on the mailing list where we discussed it and you should just follow that thread and decide what you want to do (and, in the meantime, maybe someone else has come up with another idea).  The starting post for the thread is [[https://pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users/2006-October/034807.html|here]]%0a%0aAs for other options, (1) You could have your searchbox prepopulated with an example query, like "name=*Marvin*" and hope that your visitors would see that they could replace Marvin with something else.  Not very good, but if you are interested, the way to prepopulate a searchbox is to use the "value=" parameter, like this:%0a%0a[@(:searchbox value="name=*Marvin*":)@]%0a%0aRead more about this at [[PmWiki/PageLists]]%0a%0a(2) Have you thought about making use of Categories, by placing links in your pages, for example, [@[[!Marvin]]@] in those pages that do more than just mention Marvin, but deal with Marvin in significant detail (regardless whether the page name include Marvin).  Then you could provide visitors with a pagelist of the category group, which would provide an alphabetical listing that visitors could browse.  If they click on Marvin, they get a listing of pages that you decided to display for Marvin (by adding category links).%0a%0aHope this helps.%0a%0aA: Thanks so much, I will read the thread carefully!

I'd so much like to use the pagelist function, but it's so ugly to see all the Names listed in one big Word.%0a-> Instead I want to have spaces between the words like when I first created the page. So that the spaces don't disappear, you know what I mean. So "This is a Title" gets "ThisisaTitle" now in my index, but I want it with spaces. I also created the links with spaces and they work perfectly well.%0a-%3c Marvin%0a%0aWhat I do is: (1) Add $SpaceWikiWords = 1; to my config.php file and (2) use the fmt=#title in my pagelists, which formats links as [@[[$FullName|+]]@], where the alia "|+" grabs the page title, if any, otherwise the page name.  Together, these end up giving me what I want.%0a%0aThe other thing you could do is to start giving your pagenames a title [@(:title This is the Name of This Page:)@] and, as above, using fmt=#title.%0aQ: Great! It works fine, I am happy (did the Spacewikiwords solution). Thanks a lot for your competent and quick help!%0a%0a:Update: Even better, just use the [[PmWiki/Page Variables]] [@{$Namespaced}@] or [@{$Titlespaced}@] in your pagelist template ([[Site.LocalTemplates]]).

I have set the permissions to the directories wiki.d and wikilib.d to 777. What is missing?%0a%0aHard to tell from your description.  If you provide the address, we can take a look at it.  Otherwise, you should carefully observe what, if anything, changes when you click the edit link.  Also, when you hoover the mouse cursor over the edit link, what address appears at the bottom of the screen (if your skin shown this on a mouseover?  What address appears in your browser after you click the edit link.  (What was the address before you clicked the edit button?).  In answering these questions, you can just identify the last portions of the address.%0a----%0a%0aQ: Why does the following syntax ignore the line breaks on each link and produce all links in 1 row?%0a%0a[[Link1]]%0a[[Link2]]%0a[[Link3]]%0a%0aA: In PmWiki, a single carriage return that produces a line break in the editing screen's markup does not produce line breaks in the page that is finally rendered in html (i.e. a carriage return is not translated into %3cbr> or %3cp>).  The fact that link markup is placed on separate lines does not change this.  If you want these links to appear on separate lines, there are several things you could do to tell PmWiki your intentions, including: use list markup (* or # at the start of each line), use two carrage returns instead of one, or add two slashes at the end of each line.%0a%0a----%0aQ: (September 29, 2006) Is it possible to create a Group.PageNotFound page similar to the Site.PageNotFound page?%0a-> I didn't find anything like that in the documentation, but as most things work on group level just the same as on site level, I suspect I somehow missed something.%0a%0a----%0a%0aQ: (September 26, 2006) Is there a way to add in a creative commons license to PmWiki?%0a-> I want the content my site visitors and community members write to be credited.%0aThanks.%0a%0a----%0aQ: (September 5, 2006) I'm having trouble with the initial setup of my wiki.%0a-> The links always go to Main.Homepage, no matter where they are supposed to point.  None of the PmWiki reference links work.  When an edit command is given, whether it be edit SideBar or a link to a new page, it brings up edit Main.Homepage.  Am I missing a file, or are my permissions set incorrectly?  I've tried 2.1.15, 2.1.14, and I'm now on 2.1.13.%0a%0aAlso, is there a list of what files I should have so I can check?%0a%0aA: I think we need more information.  Is there an address that we can look at?  In the meantime, if you want to try something, at least to rule out a possible issue, you might try explicitly setting the address to your PmWiki location in the $ScriptUrl entry of your config.php file.  As the documentations for $ScriptUrl explains, "PmWiki is usually fairly good about 'guessing' the correct value for $ScriptUrl on its own, but sometimes an admin needs to set it explicitly because of URL manipulations by the webserver (such as Cookbook:CleanUrls, mod_rewrite, bizarre PHP configurations, and so on)."%0a----%0aQ: The site is www.luminarias.us%0a-> I've set the scriptUrl to http://www.luminarias.us/pmwiki.php.  I'm having no luck.  None of the links work.  I've done several fresh installs in the hope that I was missing a hidden file.  The external links to pmwiki.org work, but not the internal wiki links.%0a%0aA: Ok, looking at your site, I would guess that you were trying to setup the CleanUrls recipe and that you are almost there, but not quite.  When I click on a link, the page and group are formatted as a regular path with slashes, which tells me that you have $EnablePathInfo = 1 set in your config.php file.  Then, when I try to manually enter a group and page by appending them to the address using PmWiki's own format (http://www.luminarias.us/pmwiki.php?n=Main.WikiSandbox) I get an internal server error.  It is only when I omit the pmwiki.php that I can get a the page to load (http://www.luminarias.us/?n=Main.WikiSandbox).  Wait, I also get the page to load when I try http://www.luminarias.us/index.php?n=Main.WikiSandbox.%0a%0aSo, where do you go from here?  Personally, I would take a step back first and make sure everything is working without the CleanUrls recipe: comment out the EnablePathInfo line in your Config.php and rename your .htaccess file for that it isn't being interpreted.  If the links work fine after that, then go back and double check (and triple check) your assumptions and entries in implementing the [[Cookbook:CleanUrls]] recipe.  If you need more help with that, you should probably provide some more specifics, like the contents of your .htaccess file and the exact location of that file in relationship to your PmWiki file structure.%0a----%0aQ: The internal server error came from messed up permissions on pmwiki.php.  I commented out the enablepathinfo, and that worked.  Thanks for all your help.

How scalable is PmWiki?%0a%0aA: Short answer: It all depends on the server. One user with a small, slow server and 4000 pages claims his site is barely tolerable. Another user, with a bigger and faster server, is happy with 200,000 pages. Performance can also be affected if you use some of the advanced features.%0a%0aIf it does get large enough to impact performance, there are things you can do to speed it up.%0a%0aLonger answer: https://pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users/2006-August/031282.html \\%0aThis thread includes ideas how to speed things up.%0a%0a(keywords: "server size")%0a%0a----%0aQ: (August 29th 2006) I want to include a php counter in every page generated using bbclone:%0a[@%0a%3c?php%0a    define("_BBCLONE_DIR",  "/public/homepages/username/web/bbclone/");%0a    define("COUNTER",  _BBCLONE_DIR."mark_page.php");%0a    if (is_readable(COUNTER)) include_once(COUNTER);%0a?>@]%0aThe problem is if I put these in /pmwiki/pub/skins/pmwiki/pmwiki.tmpl, they are not interpreted as php command and instead are outputed as plain html text.

By adding -PageName1,-PageName2 etc. to the PageList markup, the PageNames included can be excluded from the Category listing. Obviously only works on those specific pages, and not across the wiki in general. For example, this prevents the pages HomePage, SecretWiki and SandBox being included in the list of Categories --[[~Des]] July 06, 2006, at 07:28 AM:- [[%3c%3c]] ''its got to work without manual action for every new category added, so thanks, but sorry, its too specific''%0a%0a[=(:pagelist group=Category list=normal fmt=dictindex name=-HomePage,-SecretWiki,-SandBox:)=]%0a%0a->I'm not sure that I understand what the difference is between a list of categories, as opposed to category pages, since categories are simply pages within the category group.  If what you want is a list that doesn't create links back to those category pages, then create a pagelist template that does not enclose the reference to the page in double brackets, i.e. instead of [@* [[(=$Name}]]@] just write [@* (=$Name}@].  Then, when you add a pagelist directive that uses that format (to group=Category), the pagelist will generate a list of the names of categories (i.e., of pages in the category group), without creating links to those pages. [[%3c%3c]]   Is that what you were looking for?  If not, do you want a list of links to all categories, but are worried that the listing will cause the listing page to appear on each category page?  If so, I'm not sure that including a pagelist of categories on some page, lets call it NewPage, will cause NewPage to be listed in each of the pages in the category group.%0a%0a-->I think the problem arises when using the method where the listing is created by placing the PageList in the Category.GroupFooter page, as described in the [[PmWiki/Categories]] page. I dispensed with this as it gave me a double listing when I used a customised PageList, and included pages where the Categories were referred to (as I think the original questioner found). I just create a Category/Categories page with a PageList similar to the above in it, and it seems to list only the Categories, and not any pages that refer to Categories (unlike the GroupFooter method). After testing Pico's NewPage thought (it didn't list NewPage) I found that the name=-HomePage, section appeared to be redundant too. --[[~Des]] July 06, 2006, at 09:21 AM%0a%0a->''A category is the text placed in the markup [@[[!Your Category]]@].

You can avoid this by forcing users to use the @@Category/@@ syntax, e.g. by disabling the @@[[!@@ markup at all.%0a* the list will generate longer than a simple backlinks list; still, in new versions of PmWiki it's faster (or not?...) than in old ones thanks to implementation of the indexing system.%0a%0a->[-''~[[~MateuszCzaplinski]]''-]%0a%0a----%0aQ: (2006-06-24) When Pages are included with (:include:) in another group the text will be displayed but the pictures will not.%0a-> I could use the Groupname in the Attach-Markup like [@Attach:Groupname/Picturname.gif@], but I think it's better not to define the path of an attachment so strictly.

So, it sounds like you probably have one (or more) of those other files in your directory that is being loaded before (and instead of) index.php.  If so, you can get rid of (or rename) those files, so that they are not being automatically loaded, or you can use them as a front end, or splash screen, to call pmwiki.php.  Unless you have a particular need to use a separate index.html file, the easiest thing will probably be to just delete (or rename) that file (or files) so that index.php will be loaded.%0a%0a----%0aQ: (2006-06-13) How to add call to an external script ?%0aI have a set of scripts doing several stuffs.

BUT, I want only ONE site, which has no read protection... what can I do? Thanks!%0a%0aA: I'm not sure that I understand your question, so let me start by making sure you know about the two main documentation pages and approaches for passwords.  Passwords can be set by administrators by editing the config.php file, see [[PasswordsAdmin]], or by authors by using [@?action=attr@] to edit a regular page or the special page in each group called GroupAttributes. See [[Passwords]].  Sounds to me like you started down the narrower road of setting passwords as an author by using [@?action=attr@] to edit the GroupAttributes pages, when what you may have wanted to do was setting broader site wide passwords as an administrator by editing the config.php file.  If that is the case, at this point you may need to: (1) edit the config.php file as directed at [[PasswordsAdmin]] and then (2) go back and examine what you did as an author using [@?action=attr@] to edit the GroupAttributes pages to see whether you need to undue your prior password settings.  Hope that helps.%0a%0a->%25green%25I know this - very bad English. Sorry. I want to set a ''read'' password for the hole group (via .GroupAttributes?action=attr). But 1 page shouldn't have this read password (I want to "clear" it with .Site?action=attr), it should be readable by everybody. Is there a easy way to do this or do I have to set the attributes for all pages (many pages) in the group?%25%25%0a%0a-->What happens if you set the password for the group, and then clear the password for the page? (To clear the password on the page, you would probably have to explicitly go to the page and "assign" a password that means no password, which should be [@@nopass@], but check the documentation to be sure).%0a%0a--->%25green%25Thank you very much, I hadn't found @nopass! %25%25%0a%0a----%0aQ: (2006-05-27) Why not use frame on preview page?

If I remove the apostrophe, it works as a keyword.  If I try it as [=o'clock=] it appears to work, but when I look at the source code of the generated page, it has a bunch of squares and stuff instead of the word o'clock in the meta tag.  I don't know much about search engines & meta tags though -- perhaps I should just leave it as oclock and it would work the same way?%0a%0aA: I don't know the answer, but I might try using the ascii code for apostrophe instead of the gylph itself in the keyword.  A useful trick I sometimes use is to type a string into the search box and compare it with the string that gets displayed on the address bar.  For example, if I type "O'Clock" in the search box, the address bar ends with "O%2527Clock".  A google search confirms that 27 is the unicode html hex code for apostrophe.  I'm not sure, though, whether you will need to type the code in the form [@&#27;@] or [@&#027;@].  Take a look at the [[Special Characters]] page  for some more info about those codes.%0a%0aFrom this version's Sandbox, I looked at the html source code it generated, and used the same thing in my version of pmwiki.  Now, when I look at the html source code of both this version's Sandbox testing and on my 2.0.13 version, they look the same.  Thanks.%0a%0a----%0aQ: (2006-05-24 #2) Question regarding anchors, included pages, and if/then/else logic:%0a-> For example, say I have Page01, Page02, and Page03, all fairly lengthy with unique anchors embedded in them (I'll refer to these as the Numbered Pages).  I also have PageALL which just contains include statements for the other three pages.  On each of the Numbered Pages, there are links to anchors which are either on the current Numbered Page, or one of the other Numbered Pages.  Let's say that on Page01, there's an anchor link named anchor006 pointing elsewhere on Page01, and an anchor link named anchor007 pointing somewhere on Page03.  Can I code it so that if I'm currently on the all-pages-combined-by-includes PageALL and I click on either my anchor006 or anchor007 link, it just jumps elsewhere on the current page without having to load up the smaller Numbered Page?%0a%0aA: One approach might be to use [[Conditional Markup]] to select one of two alternate links (with, and without, the page name).  For example, if you want a link on Page01 to refer to Page02#anchor006, then you could create two different links embeded in conditions, like this:[@%0a(:if name Page01:) [[#006|GoTo 6]]%0a(:if ! name Page01:) [[Page02#006|GoTo 6]]%0a(:ifend:)%0a@]%0aWhile that may seem like a pain, you would only need to do that when you are linking to an anchor that originates on a different page from the link.  One note of caution, make sure that your anchor names are unique, e.g., don't have anchors with the same name, i.e. #006, on Page01 and Page 02, because your links to #006.  (I believe in such a case, the link will work, but will jump to the first of two anchors with the same name.  Check it out for yourself.  Maybe you might even find a way to incorporate such behavior into your system).%0a%0aLooking at the [[Conditional Markup]] page:  it seems to have exactly what I want:[@%0a(:if ( name Page01 ) OR ( name PageALL ) :)[[#006|GoTo 6]]%0a(:if ( ! name Page01 ) AND ( ! name PageALL ) :)[[Page01#006|GoTo 6]]%0a(:ifend:)%0a@]%0aIf the current page is either Page01 or PageALL, then jump to elsewhere in the current page, otherwise load up Page01 and then jump to the specified spot.  But, either I'm not coding it correctly, or I don't have a new enough version of pmWiki (I'm using 2.0.13), because I can't get it to work (two "GoTo 6" links appear on the page).  Hopefully, I'm just coding it wrong, but I have a feeling my version is too old to support this kind of logic.%0a%0a----%0aQ: (2006-05-10) I want to use a numbered list inside a table, but I cannot get the automatic numbers to be any color other than black.

One possible method might be to fill the author name based on user's IP - but that's useful only if there won't be more than one person using the same computer. Second possibility might be requiring users to use passwords - that would make it reasonably impossible for people to pretend others - but wouldn't solve the problem of not needing to login. Then, storing password and login in a cookie would help - but cookies aren't a safe place when used in such way. Finally, it's possible to imagine an external program, installed on users' machines, doing some additional identification work - but it'd be quite a challenging programming task.

When I go to the upload page, it displays links to the images that are in myurl/pmwiki/upload/, but each link is of the format myurl/pmwiki/pub/upload/Main/image.jpg.  Is this a bug?  Did I configure something wrong?%0a%0aA: I figured it out.  The answer was on the uploads help page and described how to fix this via the config.php file.%0a* $UploadDir = [="/home/john/public_html/uploads";=]%0a* $UploadUrlFmt = [="http://www.john.com/~john/uploads";=]%0a%0a----%0aQ: How do I change the group of many pages? I have made a lot of pages in the Sandbox and now I really like, what I did with PMwiki - but of course I want to get it out of the Sandbox and create a new group for these pages. How can this be done?%0a%0aA: If you have FTP file access to the wiki.d directory, the easiest way is to rename the files with the new group name.%0a%0aA: You could also see if the [[Cookbook:RenamePage]] recipe will do what you want.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is there a way to access today's date (a PHP function) to, say, show overdue items in red, or items due today in black?%0a%0aA: What is an overdue item? Is it a wiki page with a due date string as the page name perhaps? Or how would the due date be present in the page (we need page properties here, but pmwiki has not quite go them yet)? You could define a page variable for today's date in config.php, for instance like%0a->@@# add page variable {$Today}, formats today's date as yyyy-mm-dd@@%0a->@@$FmtPV['$Today'] = '[[PmWiki/Functions#PSFT|PSFT]]("[=%25Y-%25m-%25d=]", time() )';@@%0aand then you could compare today's date with the page's due date as the page name: use conditional markup like [@(:if equal {$Today} {$Name}:)The item is due today(:if:)@]%0aSomething similar could be used in a pagelist using a special custom format, so the pagelist will list items(pages) in a group, and will highlight today's due pages.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is it possible to always open external sites (for example wikipedia.org) in a new window without always typing [=%25newwin%25?=]%0a%0aA: Add to config.php:%0a->[@$UrlLinkFmt = "%3ca class='external' target='_blank' href='\$LinkUrl'>\$LinkText%3c/a>";@]%0a%0a----%0aQ: When I put the following in the wiki:%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a%25center%25centred text%0a%25right%25right aligned text%0a(:markupend:)%0athen BOTH pieces of text are centered; how do I delimit the scope of [=%25center%25=] !?%0a%0aA: Sometimes adding [=%25%25=] to the end of the line (not paragraph) can help - but not in this case, but this may help%0a(:markup class=horiz:)%0a%25center%25centred text%0a%0a%25right%25right aligned text%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aA: The default scope is the paragraph. Insert a blank line to start a new paragraph to make it work. I'm not if it is possible without a new paragraph which also adds vertical space in between. If you cannot live with the vertical space you can still use pure HTML in this special case.%0a%0aQ: But the WikiSyles page claims "the style is applied to any text that follows up to the next wikistyle specification or the end of the paragraph, whichever comes first", but [=%25right%25=] *is* a wikistyle specification before the end of the paragraph, so why doesn't the scope end there?!%0a%0aA: A solution for this is in development.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Some people has problem with editing a site. Seems that there are problem with some browsers with long lines in forms. Or it is a Wiki bug? I am using latest version. Also the RyeVoting extension seems to have problems sometimes... but can it be the browser? Thanks!%0a%0aIf you could be more specific, maybe someone could help. At the moment, I believe there are unfortunately way too much ''some''s in your question.%0a%0a----%0aQ: About search/pagelist results: Is there a way to either list matches in the name of the page before the normal results (ie searching for "pie" puts anything with "pie" in the pagename at the top of the list, results with "pie" only in the page below that), or to limit it to only looking for matches in the pagename?%0a%0aA: By default the search looks at page content. But you could do a special "name with wildcards" search, which will only look at page names, by entering @@name=*searchterm*@@ into the searchbox.%0a%0a----%0aQ: I want to set up a "did you know" function on my front page. I tried to use the RandomQuote markup at first, which works but it can only do one line. I want it show about 5 "did you knows". How would I go about setting this up? I tried just adding the markup a few more times but that doesn't work, just uses the same quote everytime.%0a%0aA: the new random quote script can have several include random directives, and they won't repeat on one page.%0a%0a----%0aQ: I do not want users to be able to show images from other websites on open wiki pages (I'm worried about getting into trouble for "bandwidth Theft")... Is there a way to disallow linking/displaying of offsite images?%0aA:See [[PmWiki/UrlApprovals]]. But it does not differentiate between links to images or links to web pages for instance. I think it would be good to ask the question on the user list.%0a%0a----%0aQ:How do I make the search box search for uploaded files?%0a%0aA: You can't. search searches the wiki pages, not the upload directory.%0a%0a----%0aQ: How do I stop users from creating new groups?  Sorry if this is obvious, but it isn't included in the documentation on groups and it's difficult to search for. Thanks.%0a%0aA: See [[Cookbook:LimitWikiGroups]]%0a%0aThanks alot.  That's exactly what I needed.  Maybe there should be a link to that page in the documentation on groups?  Anyways, I %3c3 pmwiki! [[~Mike]]%0a%0a----%0aQ: How does one prevent words from extending beyond menu borders when using extended menus cooks?%0a%0aA: If words are too long it usually requires a change to the skin's css stylesheet to make the whole sidebar wider.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Can I force SSL for a page? I have a single page that I would like to force SSL to without forcing SSL to the rest of the site. I've seen how to force SSL for the entire site, but I don't want to do that.%0a%0aA: Try putting such lines:%0a [=if( $pagename == 'Your.Page' ) {%0a     foobar%0a   }=]%0ain your local/config.php file, where ''foobar'' is the "entire-site" solution you're talking about. Maybe that can help you.%0a%0a----%0aQ: How can I embed selected PmWiki page content inside an existing web page?%0aBasically, I'd like to add an edit capability to selected pages. Their layout is content managed and different, they already posses a group / menu structure. A pmwiki layout template admits some per page individualisation but does not integrate with the existing solution. Thus I don't want to outsource them as a separated wiki but I imagine embedding wiki page content like this%0a[@%0a%3chtml> ... %3cbody>... ''custom layout and stuff''\\%0a%3cp> The next paragraph shows a list of common questions, feel free to add yours.%3c/p>\\%0a%3cp>%3c?php include(pmwikiembed.php);\\%0apmwiki_page_content(PmWiki.Questions); // here goes the content of PmWiki.Questions\\%0apmwiki_edit_button() // and the obligatory edit button\\%0a?>%3c/p> ...\\%0a%3c/body>%3c/html>%0a@]%0aApparently, this approach should disallow the creation of new wiki pages and makes no use of the pmwiki group structure.%0a%0aAs far as I noticed, pmwiki.php fetches the $pagename from POST, GET etc. parameters. Encapsulated the follwing page processing in a function pmwiki_page_content($pagename) presumably would suffice as the pmwiki page layout already can be configured down to bare bones.%0a%0a----%0aQ:I have one WikiFarm with 8 fields and I would to know if it's possible to open a page of my field1 in my field2, like if the page is on the field2, without be redirect by a link on the field1 ? Thanks!%0a%0aA: see [[Cookbook:IncludeFieldPage]].%0a%0a----%0aQ:I saw that support for groups of users ("authentication groups"?) were added in 2.1beta8, but have been unable to find any information on how to configure such groups.%0aI have a wiki that's basically closed to non-members, but would like to make a certain subset available to several collaborators.  I'd like the ability to make different sets of pages available to different individuals and would like it user-based, not just a password for a group of pages, as that's not very secure and harder to manage in the long run.  Does the authentication groups mechanism added in beta8 support what I'd like to do?  Is there a document somewhere on setting up these groups?  Thanks!%0a%0aA: See [[Site.AuthUser]].%0a%0a----%0aQ: Under Authentication Groups at the bottom, it says:%0aThis page can be used to define custom authorization groups (indicated by a leading "@" sign):%0a%0a  # @editors: alice,bob%0a  # charlie: @editors,@visitors%0a%0a... what is "This page" where we can define these groups in this format?  Should I:%0a$AuthUser['@editors'] = 'alice,bob';%0aor%0a$AuthUser['@editors'] = 'id:alice id:bob';%0aor, hopefully, is there some file or page where I can actually just define it as specified in [[Site.AuthUser]]?%0a%0aA: %25Pm%25 A: "This page" is the Site.AuthUser page itself -- edit the Site.AuthUser page to define groups.  --[[~Pm]]%0a%0a----%0aQ: The AuthUser groups functionality doesn't seem to work as I'd expect it:%0a%0aI want to keep the records of the users outside of the pages (eventually in a mySQL database). At the moment I have a .htpasswd* file thus:%0a%0a#...%0aDave Test:$1$iU3.Dz1.$aPCjq./rHgsFNR/391cdU.%0a#...%0a%0a@editors: Dave Test%0a%0aIn the config.php I have%0a%0a$AuthUser['htpasswd'] = 'local/0.htpasswd';%0a%0a*The file is called 0.htpasswd because windows won't allow me to have a file without a name; well it won't let me create one.%0a%0aWhere am I going wrong?%0a%0a''Just to add an extra bit''%0a%0aDave Test can log into the wiki with the password "@editors", which isn't what I want at all!%0aThe wiki is going to be used for collaboration in a similar style to Lotus Notes - unfortunately I can't give access because it's behind several firewalls...%0a%0aAlan%0a%0a----%0aQ:Is it possible to change the file names create automatically by PmWiki? The files I'm talking about are: Category.Category; GroupName.RecentChanges; GroupName.AllRecentChanges; Site.Form;Site.Preferences;Site.Search;Site.GroupAttributes;Site.PageNotFound;Site.PageActions and all the files that have a fixed name for it.I'am doing a site in Brazilian portuguese language and they also requested to change the name of the files and It got me worried about loosing some functionality. Thank you.%0a%0aA: Yes, nearly all filenames can be changed via various configuration variables in PmWiki.  I'll see about compiling a list.%0a%0a----%0aQ: I want to create a three level hierarchy for my wiki. A.B.C I read about categories and tried to use it but still if I am on Site C and want to go back to A.B pmwiki wants to create a new B Site. With A.B going back to A everything works fine. And I dont understand this subpage markup stuff. Is there a possibility for Non-Coders to create three level hierarchies?%0a%0aA: See [[PmWiki.HierarchicalGroups]].%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is there (or will there be) a way to include OpenDocument text in PmWiki as an alternative way of "Basic Editing"? (Currently you have to decide wether a text may be reusable or not. If the text may be reused someplace you won't put it in the wiki as you would have to do all the formating again after including the text in Word.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Help! On our "All Recent Changes" the Wiki now resorts to using a ? for the author rather than the actual author's name (after logging in). Any ideas of how to solve this?

I normally have enabled mt-blacklist.php and e-protect.php, but I commented them out in local/config.php, but this makes no difference? I am stuck here...%0aAdditional info: When I removed the "code block", that is the section of the text that was copied from a configuration file (/etc/apt/sources.list), I ''could'' save the document. The way I treated this section was to use a single space as the start of each line in order to get it "un-touched" by Pmwiki.%0a%0a----%0aQ: I wish to have a right margin per page to install a debat php shoutbox per page.would a right side bar do it ? like an indépendante right side bar per page ?%0a%0aA: [[Skins:Gemini]], [[Skins:FixFlow]] and [[Skins:Triad]] are using a RightBar page as part of the layout, which can be configured per site, per group or on a per page base.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is it possible to have indépendante side bar per différent group ?%0a%0aA: Most skins (including the PmWiki default) allow every group to have its own sidebar.  Simply create a page in the group called "`SideBar" and it is used in place of the `Site.SideBar page.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is there a way to synchronize two PmWiki instances - e.g. a central server with a local instance on a laptop for offline usage?%0a%0aA: Yes, copy the wiki.d folder to your portable with a file copy tools like robocopy (Windows)%0a%0a----%0aQ: This is copying, not synchronizing. The latter one would mean: Changes on an e.g. central server are copied to the local instance, but also vice versa. (The timestamps in the history should make it possible to find out which change was the last one, but it is nevertheless not that easy to resolv clashes. Imagine to paragraphs A and B, A is deleted on the server, B later on the local instance while A is kept on the local instance. What should the merged instance look like? Empty document? Only A? What if paragraph A was changed on the server before deleting? ...?) Maybe there is already something done for this?%0a%0a----%0aQ: [[Cookbook:AuthUser]] vs. [[Cookbook:UserAuth]]%0aI know one or both of these have people working on their development, but could we get a comparison of these two vs one another and vs the default Group/Page Authorization?

(I have a database driven, dynamic web site which I would like to convert into a wiki. I would like to write software to spew out pmwiki pages by reading the db and writing out pages. I would do this once to "seed" the wiki and let it grow organically from there.) Is there an API or file format/structure that can be used?%0a%0aA: I had this same challenge with ~1200 pages and did some study. There are only 3 fields necessary to create a pmWiki page as explained here: [[PageFileFormat]]. When you're done make sure you have the correct file permission to read/write the file from pmWiki. I spent an hour trying to figure out why I couldn't see my files from pmWiki and I finally remembered to check permissions. chmod 664 * or chmod 666 * should do it (note these commands change file permissions from within a terminal session.%0a%0aQ: That gets someone '''most''' of the way there, but [@(:pagelist:)@], doesn't know about [@$Title@] values, and refcounts are all wrong for each page that hasn't been edited via PmWiki.%0aIs there someway to ask for a global update? I could swear I saw some code to do that somewhere on this wiki once, but I can't find it again.

However, I do not get the "list below" Step 3 which gives me the example of how to post that file. I hope that made sense. Any ideas how to fix?%0a%0aA: Could you expand on "I do not get the 'list below' Step 3..." part?  By "do not get" do you mean that something is missing, or do you mean you "don't get it", as in not understanding the instructions?%0a%0a----%0aQ: How do I rename a group without copying, recreating and pasting all pages in a new group?%0a%0aA: Connect via FTP to your web-server, go to the directory ''wiki.d'' and change the groupname of the desired file(s).  Or have your administrator install the [[Cookbook:RenamePage]] recipe.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Problems with uploads (especially graphics) with standalone version of pmwiki 2.0.6%0a%0aI have used the standalone package in order to install the pmwiki on a Windows XP machine and use the monobook skin.

The link is red for showing still not available (monobook skin specific). After uploading the picture, the link turns blue to show that the specified link is available. Putting my mouse on the link shows the correct directory [@http://localhost/wiki/uploads/example.jpg@]%0aHowever, clicking on the link leads me to the page [@http://localhost/wiki/Example/Jpg@] with the comment: "Describe Jpg here."

Now anyone can edit sidebar.%0a%0a->The sidebar usually is part of the Site group. It would be a good idea to set a special password for all pages in the Site group. To set a password for the group, you access the GroupAttributes page.

I want to view my wiki on my local machine.%0a%0aA: You need a program to download all of the files and follow all of the links. At download.com  there are a number of programs called offline browsers.%0a%0aI found a great program called HTTTrack which can be found at https://www.httrack.com/. It appears to be an open source GPL'ed program. It will download your wiki to a folder on your hard drive.

[[tdoo]] 13 April 2006, 13:15%0a%0aA: First, ideally: you change the name during the upload process to close the gaps.  An uploaded file does not have to have the same name on the server that it had on your source disk.  Second, for files that have already been uploaded with spaces in their names: in wiki links, replace the spaces with the code [@%2520@], for example use [@Drive:/My%2520Image.gif@].%0a%0a----%0aQ: When login in with admin password (set in the ''$DefaultPasswords'') the authid does't reflect the authentication.%0aAfter login the '''[@(:if authid:)@]''' still reports false.

Then you can make a pagelist group=pet and list all pets. How can you have pages in two categories?

I want to create a Wiki page dynamically with a script and include it or import it into the Wiki.  How can I do this?%0aA: See [[Cookbook:ImportText]], and [[PmWiki/PageFileFormat]]%0a%0aA: If your script will create files, then you need to provide think about the following:%0a* Where to save it?

Pm suggest the following three as the minimum: version= text= and ctime=  See [[PmWiki/PageFileFormat]]%0a* How do I tell PmWiki about the new page I created?  If you create a new file and then edit it through PmWiki, then PmWiki will know everything it needs to know when it does a save.  If you want force PmWiki to know about the file before it is edited and saved, you need to hook into PmWiki's existing function(s) for storing pages.

You are correct that I was in the process of upgrading, but I only ran the upgrade after discovering this problem in the hope that it would fix it.  btw The question below [now a part of the question above, [[~Henning]]] was supposed to be a footnote to this question - I'm running PmWiki on a local install of Apache (for testing/dev before "go live"), and I tried uploading what I had to a proper server to see if it was something with my Apache/PHP install.

Jean.%0a%0a----%0aQ: Is there a way to make the upload and attach fit into a single interface?%0a-> For instance, you want to attach an image file to a page, you don't have to type the name of the file when you're attaching it after uploading. When you click the attach button, you'll just look for your file and then after selecting your file, the markup for that image is already generated.%0a>>green%3c%3c%0aA: Yes, use, say Cookbook:UploadForm and Cookbook:ThumbList.%0a-> See for example a [[https://kiwiwiki.nz/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administration/TemplateUpload|template upload form]], place this say, in the group header.%0aThen place a thumblist or thumbgallery direct in the group footer, or in the page ([[https://ttc.org.nz/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Photos/2009-08-22-Cupola|an example]]) [-[[~simon]] July 22, 2010, at 06:50 PM-]%0a>>%3c%3c%0a----%0a%0aQ: Command { $ LastModified } is to get time and date of last modificated  '''page '''.%0a-> Is there something similar for  '''file ''' that was attached?%0a%0a----%0aQ: Why are translations not loaded ?%0a-> I've downloaded and installed the language pack for Norwegian in my wiki, added the XLPage line to the config.php according to the [[Internationalizations]] directives but the translations are not loaded.

Any idea why this is so ? --[[~Andreas]] March 14, 2011, at 07:26 AM%0a%0a----%0aQ: How can I properly indent a block?%0a-> I've tried it this way but it looks sometimes very ugly (second or third border)%0a%0a[=   -->%25block border='1px solid' padding='3px'%25[@ =] \\%0a[=   hello =]\\%0a[=   world =]\\%0a[=   @] =]\\%0a%0a-->%25block border='1px solid' padding='3px'%25[@%0ahello%0aworld%0a@]%0a%0a----%0aQ: I need to upload hundred images. How can I upload them in the same time rather than upload them one by one?%0aJune 06, 2011%0a%0aA: You can upload them via FTP/SCP/SSH. See also Cookbook:DragDropMultiUpload.%0a----%0aQ: I'm customizing a PHP page, and I'm trying to use an absolute link to a file as I build my html. I'm doing this:%0a%0a-> @@[="https://www.pmwiki.org";=]@@%0a%0abut it's coming out like this:%0a%0a-> @@[="%3ca class='urllink' href='https://www.pmwiki.org' rel='nofollow'>https://www.pmwiki.org%3c/a>"=]@@%0a%0aIt's supposed to be this:%0a%0a-> @@[=%3csource src="https://www.pmwiki.org/pub/Audio/test.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" />=]@@%0a%0abut it's coming out like this:%0a%0a-> @@[=%3csource src="%3ca class='urllink' href='https://www.pmwiki.org/pub/Audio/eduardo.mp3' rel='nofollow'>https://www.pmwiki.org/pub/Audio/eduardo.mp3%3c/a>" type="audio/mpeg" />=]@@%0a%0a(I've replaced the actual domain with this one, and simplified the paths a little.) What am I screwing up?%0a%0a%25Py%25 PmWiki automatically creates links of URL addresses in the page. To protect the plain text from processing, surround it with [@[=...=]@], for example, see below. --[[~Petko]] June 21, 2013, at 04:28 PM%0a%0a(:markup:)%0aLink: https://pmwiki.org.%0aNot link: [=https://pmwiki.org=].%0a(:markupend:)%0a%0aA: I fixed it like this:%0a%0aInstead of @@"https://www.pmwiki.org"@@, I did @@"httpHTML"@@. Then I added this line:%0a%0a-> @@Markup('httpHTML', '%3ctable', '/httpHTML/', 'https://www.pmwiki.org');@@%0a%0aThat got past my references to the url being converted into links.%0a----%0aQ: Can you make better use of vertical space when editing? Buttons and text on several lines could be combined into one line leaving more vertical space for the main text editing area. For example, Summary and Author could be put onto the same line, so could the buttons. The editing window is wide enough, just not tall enough. The help box near the bottom could be replaced with a "help" icon/button/link that displays the help box when you "mouseover" it (like a tootip).%0a%0aA: %25Py%25 Yes, you can make both better and worse use of both vertical and horizontal space, in fact you can completely change the editing interface either in [@Site.EditForm@] or by redefining the variables $PageEditForm or $PageEditFmt. For example: you can replace the "Author:" and "Summary:" texts with in-field placeholder values; if you enable AuthUser you may remove the Author field; if you never type an edit summary that field can drop; you can add a "page title" field; I personally have 3 additional submit buttons to help me with de-spam and de-sandbox cleanups. OTOH the screens have become both larger (desktop) and smaller (mobile) and the latter don't have mouses so the mouseover event is no longer reliable, but nothing can prevent you from implementing it if it works for you. :-) --[[~Petko]] May 08, 2019, at 08:52 AM%0a%0aThanks for the response - gnuzoo%0a----%0aQ: I cannot seem get the "[@!!@]" markup to work in my page for Site.SkinElements I want to make some of %0athe text really big (like H1).%0a%0aFrom my new pmwiki install Site.SkinElements:%0a[@%0a[[#skinheader]]%0a!!Here is the text of the skin header.%0a[[#skinheaderend]]%0a@]%0a%0aUsing something like [@%25blue%25@] work, but not the double exclamation marks.%0a%0aA: I have tested this both on my home wiki and [[https://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Site/SkinElements?action=diff#diff1570744019|here]] and it did work fine.

Petko, can you chat? If not, can we setup a pmwiki page to act like a chat? When I post on this page you usually reply rather rapidly.%0aI propose we setup a page designated for psuedo-chatting questions for any topic and answers. %0a%0aA: %25Py%25 Considering my ''free'' time is limited, a better use of this resource would be a discussion that might help other people in situations similar to yours. That's why I suggest writing on the talk pages in the documentation or in the cookbook -- this shows that you searched for a solution and didn't find it, and placed your question exactly where you expected to be documented. Please review [[PmWiki:How to get assistance]] for inspiration. If other people need the same information later, they are more likely to find it, without wasting the time resource (theirs and mine). OTOH, you can [[PmWiki:Support|get private paid support]] but as we live in different timezones several hours apart, I would recommend e-mail rather than chat. --[[~Petko]] November 06, 2019, at 09:37 AM%0a%0a%0aI still think an "any topic" chat/talk page is a good idea. I find the documentation too often does not clearly communicate to me. Anyone could provide answers, not just you. --[[~gnuzoo]]%0a%0a-> I tried using your [[PmWiki/Chat]] page. I think it is useable to ask common questions. [[~Finar]] November 12, 2019, at 08:29 AM%0a%0a%25Py%25 I disagree, one more page where people post "any topic chat" questions is a waste of our time, and encourages a lack of respect for our work. There is already an actual chat where you can post questions, go to the IRC Channel #pmwiki on irc.freenode.net. --[[~Petko]] %0a%0aYes - the IRC chat was where PM used to chat all day long. Some days he would only be on for a couple hours, sometimes less, sometimes more. The problem is that now nobody is ever on IRC #pmwiki. By referencing IRC, does that mean you are going to be on it?%0aPlease let me clarify, by "any topic chat" page I prefer to rephrase it as "any PMWiki topic chat" page. I would not consider it a waste of time, and certainly no where near being disrespectful.%0a%0aMy take is all active projects out there have a discord and/or telegram and/or github.  I'm super old school and even I haven't been on IRC in maybe 10 years.  Not having these is holding us back and veterens don't really have a way to easily give back to the community.  Pmwiki.org will always be a well-worn reference for those running wiki(s) but to onboard, keeping up with where people are at is important.  We need to respect ''everyones'' time and that includes people searching for the wiki software that is right for them by asking a few quick questions on a forum they frequent. The more accessible the forum, the more other people can answer questions and take load off Petko [[~Naturevault]] @2022-10-23T15:59:37Z%0a----%0aCan someone please help me fix this recipe:%0a%0a    [[Cookbook/RedirectSilent]]%0a%0a--[[~gnuzoo]]%0a----%0aI think this page was spammed because the last edit links to a website that firefox says "Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"%0aCan you fix it?%0a    [[https://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/DomTT-Talk]]%0a--[[~gnuzoo]]%0a----%0a''InterMap feature request moved to PITS:01446.''%0a
