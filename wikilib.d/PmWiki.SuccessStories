PmWiki was the ideal solution for the club. It offered simple editing, version control and the ability to implement a password protected &#8220;members only&#8221; section.  The key to PmWiki&#8217;s success is its separation of simplicity and power &#8211; that is power to the administrator and simplicity for the content authors.  The administrators (the ones needing the power) are the tech guys at [[http://www.papercut.com/ | PaperCut Software]] who were kind enough to donate their server resources and time, and the authors are the &#8220;simpler&#8221; guys at the gliding club.%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a%0a%0a----%0a'''bilder-gucken.net''' (http://www.bilder-gucken.net)%0a%0a%25lfloat%25[[http://www.bilder-gucken.net| Attach:bilder-gucken-net-screen.jpg]]%0aThis german website is about my offer of tarot readings.

[[http://www.piotr.szczepanski.name/|my homepage]], [[http://lwow.piotr.szczepanski.name/|a website]] about [[Wikipedia:Lviv|Lviv]], and some [[http://o.staszic.waw.pl/|other one]] too at the moment, and can be easily extended to more in the future -- it is as simple as issuing an @@mkdir sites/www.example.com/@@ and creating a @@local/config.php@@ in this directory. The site-dependent @@config.php@@ file has virtually just a few lines, as most stuff is configured site-wide in @@farmconfig.php@@, @@extconfig.php@@ (loads extensions, included ''from'' the site @@config.php@@), and @@i18n.LN.php@@ which contains all the language-dependent stuff (@@LN@@ stands for language, currently @@en@@ or @@pl@@).%0a%0aAll of this is possible thanks to [[PmWiki]]'s excellent flexibility (virtually no need to modify the core code, except removing inline CSS and customizing the error message). [[http://httpd.apache.org/|Apache]]'s [[http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html|mod_rewrite]] is also involved. The [[Cookbook:Cookbook|Cookbook]] extensions used are: [[Cookbook:Beautifier|Beautifier]] (not really needed at the moment), [[Cookbook:CommentBoxPlus|CommentBoxPlus]], [[Cookbook:MarkupExtensions|MarkupExtensions]], [[Cookbook:Flash|Flash]] (again, not in use now), [[Cookbook:LinkTitles]], [[Cookbook:MediaCategories|MediaCat]], [[Cookbook:MergeMetaTags|MergeMetaTags]] (disabled for now, not working), [[Cookbook:PageTableOfContents|PageToc]], [[Cookbook:SearchHighLight|SearchHighLight]] (originally not Unicode-clear, but I implemented a lame fix), [[Cookbook:UserAuth|UserAuth]], [[Cookbook:PresenceAwarenessLight|PresenceAwarenessLight]] (turned off for now), [[Cookbook:RandomQuote|RandomQuote]] and [[Cookbook:ViewModes|ViewModes]].%0a%0aI have also rewritten the [[Cookbook:VisitorsLogging1337|VisitorsLogging]] script for use on this page.

The primary goal of the website is to create a consistent, up-to-date resource for individual structures, with each database record/page based on verifiable facts presented in an easily accessed framework.%0a%0aWiki software looked most promising as a platform, mostly for its crowd-sourcing features. After trying MediaWiki and finding it extremely powerful but hard to develop and manage, we chose PmWiki for its simplicity, flexibility, rock-solid design and maturity, and because the primary site developer was intimately familiar with its workings.%0a%0a%25rfloat%25Attach:ForThePmWikiSite2.gif%0a%0aWe launched the site on January 1, 2013. As of September 2017 it contains nearly 1,900 pages, each containing information on a specific structure. It's growing slowly but steadily. Local preservationists have found the site useful, mostly so any building of concern has a "home on the web" where anyone can access current, factual information.%0a%0aWe're using the following Cookbook recipes:%0a*Monobook skin, for its MediaWiki-like appearance and features.%0a*Media Categories, to handle MediaWiki-style categories/tags.%0a*Drag & Drop Multi Upload, to make uploading images easier.%0a*IfInText, a small recipe I created based on a mailing list suggestion by Hans Bracker.

We're making extensive use of pagelists to present information based on the site's categories. As we've learned more about pagelists, page variables, includes, group headers and footers and the nuances of namespaces, we're able to semi-automatically create varied and complex pages with useful pagelist displays, all without a lot of work (except at the beginning).%0a%0aPmWiki's a winner as Version 1.0 of this project and has performed flawlessly. We'll be looking at more robust database-driven development for Version 2.0, mostly because we're identifying desired features beyond the scope of PmWiki (or probably any wiki software), such as heavy incorporation of mapping/GIS, more complex querying and more advanced styling and display.%0a%0aWe originally planned to have lots of authors and editors, but have found even the straightforward PmWiki markup to be too big a hurdle for most of our audience. Luckily, a couple of us are database guys from way back and really enjoy working with markup, consistent page structure and a bit of PmWiki-style coding, and we're making the progress we were hoping for when we started.%0a%0aWe'd be glad to share more of this experience with anyone who's interested.

By the way, my web host doesn't have command line access, but I am able to install, configure, and run PmWiki without any problems.  Thanks!%0a%0a----%0a''''wiki.rowi.net (http://wiki.rowi.net)%0a%0a%25lfloat%25 http://wiki.rowi.net%0a%0aA long time I coded html and PHP myself. Editing with vi after logging in with a secure shell was not a quick thing to put some new ideas to a web place. So I found PMWiki for putting my ideas and knowledge to my own webserver just by using the browser. It was (and is) a pleasure to have a handy tool for getting ideas, knowledge and more into a webbased system. Then, somebody of my german Volkswagen Scirocco Forum (http://www.sciroccoforum.de) told me that he would like to put a Scirocco knowlege base to the web. Well, PMWiki could do this and now there are nearly 4000 people coming from the forum who are able to edit all the details about this car. Nevertheless, I'm writing tips and hints to the wiki for all things of life like SecondLife, GPS systems, VoIP and much more. It's a source for all information I have in mind or maybe should remember of.%0a%0a[[%3c%3c]]%0a%0a----%0a'''WikiHistory''' (http://www.wikihistory.org)%0a%0a%25lfloat%25 http://www.wikihistory.org/pub/skins/monobook/wikihistory.png%0a%0a[[http://www.wikihistory.org | WikiHistory]] is an open World history online.%0aWhen I decided the World needed an open history book it was obvious to me that a wiki was the way to make it happen. After some research, PmWiki was the one that was recommended. You have no idea how happy I was when it "just worked". It was easy to install, and adding skins was simple. I love it. I hope everyone helps fill in the history now!%0a\\%0a\\%0a%0a----%0a'''WikiObits''' (http://www.WikiObits.com)%0a%25lfloat%25[[https://WikiObits.com/ | https://www.wikiobits.com/wiki/pub/skins/mobile/wikiobits-logo.gif]]%0a %0a[[https://www.WikiObits.com|WikiObits]] is an obituary site where you can write your own obit.%0a%0aPmWiki is the perfect platform on which to build a medium sized wiki. I chose it in part because it does not need a SQL database so it's much less complicated to manage than others. %0a\\%0a\\%0a%0a----%0a%0a'''[[http://wikimatze.de | wikiMatze]] - the personal homepage of Matthias Günther'''  %0a%0a%0awikimatze is a page of my personal favors: Linux, Ruby, Scala, Hiking, Warhammer and of course wikis. After experiencing with many different systems out there I decided to use  pmwiki because it is so easy to set up a homepage. You can understand the cutting edges of this wiki system with ease. There is much docu about every aspect of it. You can easily contribute, just click on the edit button here and change the content. If you want to create your own template - feel free to do so. There is an great community out here and if you want to write a recipe just do it right. Don't hesitate to ask something on the mailing lists you will get answers to your questions and great feedback.%0a%0a%0aHere are the recipe I'm using:%0a%0a* [[Cookbook/BlogIt]] - a great piece of software to make a blog with pmwiki very easy%0a* [[Cookbook/DeObMail]] - save your contact address from being harvested%0a* [[Cookbook/Syntaxlove]] - your code examples must look sexy%0a* [[Cookbook/Mini]] - Petkos great tool for embedding a lightbox for your images%0a* [[Cookbook/WebsiteIcon]] - every page needs a nice favicon%0a%0a%0a->[[~MatthiasGünther]]%0a%0a%0a----%0a%0aI am a builder based in Goole, East Yorkshire and I built my website at %25newwin%25[[http://www.wc-ltd.co.uk/|Wilcock's Contractor's Ltd]] using PMwiki because I found it easier to learn than conventional website creation software and more convenient to update.%0a%0a----%0a%0a%0a'''Words2u''' %25newwin%25[[http://www.words2u.net | (www.words2u.net)]]%0a%0aWords2u.net started as and is mainly a Costa Rica GPS wiki. The original intention was to have a section of my own data, and another for user content. As it happened, my personal part grew from tracks, bus routes and points of interest in Costa Rica, to include some trails outside the country, and the users have not contributed that much. Still, this is a collection of GPS data for Costa Rica that has no known parallel.%0a%0aPmWiki helped me customize my content presentation, control access to it for writing and sometimes for reading as well. It is an outstanding program with lot of community support. I had questions answered within hours or even minutes, and was able to solve any glitch very quickly. PmWiki is easy to install, customize and maintain, has a small footprint and runs solidly even on less powerful computers. It has not crashed once since I started using it, and it responds extremely fast and renders correctly on any browser I can think of.%0a%0aI am so impressed with PmWiki that I now converted to a wiki farm. I created  my %25newwin%25'''[[http://www.words2u.net/recipes/ | Food and Recipe wiki]]''' and put %25newwin%25[[http://www.words2u.net/recipes/index.php?n=Recipes.Recipes |my recipe collection]] (among other things) on the site for use in the kitchen.

I'm only just beginning to realise the power of it, and the learning curve, from installing recipes, through fiddling with the CSSes and templates, to finally coding my own solutions with directives or from scratch, has been downhill all the way. That's the hallmark of an architecture that Einstein would have liked: as simple as possible but no simpler. Thanks for being gifted!%0a%0aAdrian.
